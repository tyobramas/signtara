The reference thumbnails in `web/ref/` are derived from the same MIT-licensed
dataset (resized copies, 3 per letter).

## Repositories studied as references

Used as **architectural references**, not copied:

- `khairul3/BISINDO-Sign-Language-Recognition` — BISINDO recognition approach
- `daf2a/Sign_Language_Translator_Web_App` — MediaPipe-in-webapp patterns
- `gabguerin/Sign-Language-Recognition--MediaPipe-DTW` — landmarks → classification

All code in this repository was written by the Jemari team, except the
components listed in the tables above.

## BISARA TwoHand v1 update

The active model is now an independently implemented nearest-prototype classifier fitted on the original MIT-licensed alphabet photographs, not Jemari's 63-feature classifier. Dataset source: https://github.com/rhiosutoyo/Indonesian-Sign-Language-BISINDO-Hand-Sign-Detection-Dataset, commit e1a48c6caa9d12318c8561e9962da845ab50226e, Copyright (c) 2024 Rhio Sutoyo. Exact MIT notice is in public/licenses/Alphabet-Dataset-MIT.txt. Full-resolution original training photographs are included with per-image provenance. The earlier Jemari claim of three thumbnails per letter resolved to repeated references to one unique file per letter; the new index intentionally lists one representative training photo per letter.

Jemari legacy code/weights remain MIT-attributed but are not the active classifier. MediaPipe runtime and hand landmark model remain Apache-2.0. No word recognition repository code, weights or WL-BISINDO videos are redistributed.
